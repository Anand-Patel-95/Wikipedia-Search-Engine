- [iPython Notebook of Wikipedia PageRank](): Walks through the development of this PageRank algorithm. This code is customized to handle unbalanced edge weights and decimal edge weights. This PageRank implementation is packaged and used in other projects such as creating a flight delay network to find the most delay heavy airports in the United States: see [Notebook here](https://github.com/Anand-Patel-95/Predicting-Flight-Delays-for-Airlines/blob/main/EDA_anand_PageRank_starter.ipynb).
