    "> __a)__ A social network dataset, like from Facebook or Instagram, would be appropriate to represent as a graph. Let's take Instagram as our example. The nodes would be individual accounts/user profiles and the edges between a starting and ending node would represent if the starting user follows the ending user. The graph is directed because each edge indicates the first account following the second account, and this interaction is one-way. A seperate edge going from account 2 to account 1 is needed to show a \"follow back\". The average in-degree of a node means the number of accounts following the particular account associated with this node.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Graphs are hard to work with in map-reduce paradigm because each edge references information about other nodes. Since nodes have information about other nodes, it can be hard to process each node as an individual record.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Dijskra's algorithm finds the single source shortest path on a weighted graph. While exploring the graph from the starting node, it uses a priority queue to keep track of a frontier of nodes to expand next. The priority is deceided by the order of their total distance from the starting node. If a shorter distance to a node from the starting node is found, that distance replaces the longer path. The priority queue is used to choose the next node to expand, and the one with the shortest distance to start is popped from the queue. Once the queue is empty, all the shortest paths from our starting node have been discovered.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This algorithm is hard to parallelize because we would need to keep a priority queue in memory for all workers, and this does not scale well with a large graph where we might have many nodes in the queue at a time. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Insertion into priority queue is a sequential operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ Parallel BFS solves this problem by adding a field to keep track of the node's status (`unvisited`, `queue`, `visited`) to tell the algorithm if each node/record should be expanded. This gets rid of a priority queue that would have tracked the nodes to be visited next.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The expense of this design is that we need to do multiple iterations over the entire dataset to change and process these node statuses as we explore all the nodes in the graph."

    "> __a)__ This graph from figure 5.1 in Lin & Dyer is sparse. There are mostly 0 entries in the adjacency matrix (16/25 possible edges are 0), making the graph sparse. A sparse graph will include fewer potential edges between all nodes, and the adjacency matrix will have more 0 entries there as a result. This representation is not memory efficient because we are storing data on all these 0 entries. On the other hand, the adjacency lists for a sparse matrix are short for each node and much more efficient for memory storage because we do not need to store 0's. We just store 1's.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ This is a directed graph because we see edges as 1-way, arrow connections between nodes. There is an edge from A to B, and this is only one way. We would need an edge from B to A as a seperate relationship in this graph. Adjacency matricies for directed graphs require the order to matter, and are not symmetrical like they are for undirected graphs. This means that an entry for (A,B) can have a different value than (B,A) as we do here (`1`, and `0` respectively)."

    "# Question 3: Markov Chains and Random Walks\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know from your readings and in class discussions, the PageRank algorithm takes advantage of the machinery of Markov Chains to compute the relative importance of a webpage using the hyperlink structure of the web (we'll refer to this as the 'web-graph'). A Markov Chain is a discrete-time stochastic process. The stochastic matrix has a principal left eigen vector corresponding to its largest eigen value which is one. A Markov chain's probability distribution over its states may be viewed as a probability vector. This steady state probability for a state is the PageRank of the corresponding webpage. In this question we'll briefly discuss a few concepts that are key to understanding the math behind PageRank. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3 Tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ It is common to explain PageRank using the analogy of a web surfer who clicks on links at random ad infinitum. In the context of this hypothetical infinite random walk, what does the PageRank metric measure/represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ What is the \"Markov Property\" and what does it mean in the context of PageRank?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ A Markov chain consists of $n$ states plus an $n\\times n$ transition probability matrix. In the context of PageRank & a random walk over the WebGraph what are the $n$ states? what implications does this have about the size of the transition matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code + short response:__ What is a \"right stochastic matrix\"? Fill in the code below to compute the transition matrix for the toy graph from question 2. [__`HINT:`__ _It should be right stochastic. Using numpy this calculation can be done in one line of code._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ To compute the stable state distribution (i.e. PageRank) of a \"nice\" graph we can apply the power iteration method - repeatedly multiplying the transition matrix by itself, until the values no longer change. Apply this strategy to your transition matrix from `part d` to find the PageRank for each of the pages in your toy graph. Your code should print the results of each iteration. How many iterations does it take to converge? Which node is most 'central' (i.e. highest ranked)? Does this match your intuition? \n",
    "    * __`NOTE 1:`__ _this is a naive approach, we'll unpack what it means to be \"nice\" in the next question_.\n",
    "    * __`NOTE 2:`__ _no need to implement a stopping criteria, visual inspection should suffice_."

    "### Q3 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ PageRank measures how important a webpage is based on how many times this page is linked to other webpages. In the the context of the infinite random walk, PageRank metric for a node/webpage represents how much time the random walker spends on that given node/webpage. Each node will have a PageRank metric assigned to it, and they represent the probability distribution over all the nodes/webpages for how likely the surfer is to be at that particular node at a given time during the random walk. Higher scores mean more people are likely to frequent this webpage, so it must be an important page relative to others in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ A Markov chain is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another, between a finite or countable number of possible states.\n",
    "\tThe \"Markov Property\" is characterized by memoryless: The next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it. In the context of PageRank, it means that the probability of going to the next page is only dependent on the current page (which pages are linked from here) and not the entire path or web browsing history before it. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The `n` states are the webpages in our web graph. This implies that the transition matrix, of size $n^2$, will be very large since `n` is the number of webpages out on the web. The number of pages on the web is estimated to be in the trillions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ A right stochastic matrix is a square matrix of nonnegative real numbers, with each row summing to 1 (async). A right stochastic matrix represents a graph where the weight of out-edges from a node all sum to 1. Therefore, each row in this matrix should sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The stable state distribution (PageRank) of the graph converges by iteration 7. Node E is the most central node because it has the highest steady state probability, and we expect this from visual inspection."

    "> __a)__ The probabilities are not converging, and with each iteration they become smaller and smaller. The row of probabilities should sum to 1 but these do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ The dangling node is E because it is a sink for edges but has no outgoing edges. For a Markov Chain and PageRank to work, we need stochasticity and this fails because the dangling node does not redistribute the incoming mass.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ A graph is irreducible if there is a path from every node to every other node. The webgraph is not naturally irreducible because some webpages cannot reach other webpages without typing into the URL since a hyperlink chain might not exist. \n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ A graph is aperiodic if the period, or greatest common divisor (GCD), of all cycle lengths is 1. Aperiodicity: When starting from some state i, we don't know when we will return to the same state i after some transition. We may see the state i after 1,2,3,4,5.. etc number of transition ([source](https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/385070)). A webgraph is naturally aperiodic because we just need 1 page to have a hyperlink back to itself for the minimum period to be 1. This is commonly found on the huge internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ PageRank modifies the webgraph to include a teleportation chance so that each node, and particularly dangling nodes, are escapable by the random surfer who ends up on that page. This connects all nodes in the graph and provides irreducibility. Having a webpage link to itself in the webgraph can guarantee aperiodicity. Lastly, redistributing the probability mass of dangling node webpages to the rest of the nodes/webpages in the graph allow us to handle dangling nodes. These changes amount to the Stochasticity adjustment and Primitivity adjustment, which allow us to guarantee aperiodicity and irreducibility."

    "> __a)__ The data in `testRDD` appears to be an adjacency list. The first value represents a node id for a given webpage. The second part of each line is a dictionary with keys of linked webpages, or node ids, that the main webpage links to and values for the number of times that webpage is linked in the main webpage. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Records in the raw dataset are just pages that include hyperlinks to various other pages. That's what this count of records returns. Pages can exist on wikipedia without containing any hyperlinks to other pages. These pages can still be linked to, particularly by the records we are counting, but do not contain links to other pages themselves. These nodes will not have any out-edges so they will not have a record in the raw dataset, but they will still have in-edges and be referenced in the adjacency lists so they are still part of the graph. These would still be nodes in our graph and contribute to the total number of nodes, but won't be included in the total number of records.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ The dangling nodes are defined as nodes that do not link to any other nodes, and serve as a sink for edges. Dangling nodes are nodes in the graph that have no outgoing edges (dead-end nodes), i.e., their adjacency lists are empty. We calculate the number of them by subtracting the total number of nodes in the graph by the total number of records in the raw dataset (starting nodes): `15,192,277 - 5,781,290 = 9,410,987`"

The number of intermediate records required to update PageRank is related to the number of edges in the graph. In this question you'll compute the average number of hyperlinks on each page in this data and visualize a distribution for these counts (the out-degree of the nodes). \n",

    "# Question 7 - PageRank part 1 (Initialize the Graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the challenges of performing distributed graph computation is that you must pass the entire graph structure through each iteration of your algorithm. As usual, we seek to design our computation so that as much work as possible can be done using the contents of a single record. In the case of PageRank, we'll need each record to include a node, its list of neighbors and its (current) rank. In this question you'll initialize the graph by creating a record for each dangling node and by setting the initial rank to 1/N for all nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "__`NOTE:`__ Your solution should _not_ hard code \\\\(N\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ What is \\\\(N\\\\)? Use the analogy of the infinite random web-surfer to explain why we'll initialize each node's rank to \\\\(\\frac{1}{N}\\\\). (i.e. what is the probabilistic interpretation of this choice?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ Will it be more efficient to compute \\\\(N\\\\) before initializing records for each dangling node or after? Explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Fill in the missing code below to create a Spark job that:\n",
    "  * parses each input record\n",
    "  * creates a new record for any dangling nodes and sets it list of neighbors to be an empty set\n",
    "  * initializes a rank of 1/N for each node\n",
    "  * returns a pair RDD with records in the format specified by the docstring\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code:__ Run the provided code to confirm that your job in `part a` has a record for each node and that your should records match the format specified in the docstring and the count should match what you computed in question 5. [__`TIP:`__ _you might want to take a moment to write out what the expected output should be fore the test graph, this will help you know your code works as expected_]\n",
    " \n",
